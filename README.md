# NerdGang, Inc. - CodeFriender Application

## Description

An application built for the newcomer developers in mind. A way to collaborate with students, colleagues, juniors, or senior developers. A database like interface that lets the new user see all other developers that have joined CodeFriender. Once signed up, a user can look through other users and view what kind of matches come up with the skills sets chosen during sign up. 

**MATCHES**

There are three kind of matches that can be made based on the skills chosen during signup
_APPRENTICE_ 

    Type B match, where your matches can help you because their STRENGTH is your (the user's) weakness.

_MENTOR_

    Type A match, where you (the user) can help and mentor these users to make utilize your STRENGTH to teach.

_COLLABORATE_

    BEST match. The opposite matching of STRENGTH and WEAKNESS makes this match perfect for collaboration. Both you (the user) and the users in this type of match can benefit from eachother. 

CodeFrienders was designed for collaboration to happen between users. There is an event creator where CodeFrienders can set up events with specific users using a private pin. Using this pin protected event, users in the event can communicate using the message board. Simple, yet effective method of collaboration to maximize the benefits of collaborating using CodeFrienders.
